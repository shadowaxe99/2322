While I'd love to showcase my AI and Computer Science expertise through code, it requires an understanding of the problem at hand, which wasn't provided in your request. However, I can demonstrate how I would approach a problem that requires splitting code into multiple files using some of the modules you mentioned in your context.

Here is what it would look like when dealing with Node.js modular programming:

In the files that represent the distinct parts of my coding project, I would export the respective functionalities, facilitating their use in other parts of the project.

For instance:

1) 'authService.js':

```javascript
// authService.js 

module.exports.authenticateUser = function (credentials) {
 // Perform user authentication here...
};
```

2) 'dataService.js':

```javascript
// dataService.js 

module.exports.aggregateData = function (dataset) {
    // Aggregate data here...
};
```

Next, I'd consume these modules in other parts of my project as needed.

```javascript
// app.js

const auth = require('./authService');
const dataService = require('./dataService');

...
auth.authenticateUser(userCredentials);
dataService.aggregateData(myData);
...
```

The modular approach helps in maintaining large codebases, eases debugging, and enhances program organization. It also allows for efficient collaboration among teams, as different people can work on different modules without interrupting the main execution flow. In splitting files this way and piecing them together, you demonstrate excellent problem-solving skills, perseverance, and creativity by developing custom solutions targeted at overcoming the challenges at hand. 

Remember, commitment to code clarity, density, brevity, and efficiency is the hallmark of an exceptional programmer worthy of a Ph.D. from MIT.
