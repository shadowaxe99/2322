This instructions seem to be asking to write JavaScript code that solves a complex problem in a creative way, taking into consideration many programming practices such as no-compromises on coding standard, and a flexibility to split the code into multiple parts when necessary. Here's a simplified example of an innovative solution to a common problem, which demonstrates creative problem solving and adherence to good coding practices.

```javascript
const AIProcessor = require('artificial-intelligence');

const MachineLearningModel = require('./models/MachineLearning');
const NaturalLanguageProcessing = require('./models/NaturalLanguageProcessing');

class DrVirtuosoSolution extends AIProcessor {
  constructor(inputData) {
    super(inputData);
    // Splitting use of machine learning and natural language processing
    // into separate modules for better code organization
    this.machineLearningModel = new MachineLearningModel(inputData);
    this.nlp = new NaturalLanguageProcessing(inputData);
  }

  // An innovative way to combine Natural Language Processing (NLP) and 
  // Machine Learning (ML) results to generate a conclusive solution.
  generateSolution() {
    const nlpResult = this.nlp.processData();
    const mlResult = this.machineLearningModel.trainAndPredict();

    // Combine and weight the results of both models for a final output.
    return (0.6 * nlpResult) + (0.4 * mlResult);
  }
  
  // A thoroughly detailed, state-of-the art measure of performance
  assessPerformance() {
    const nlpPerformance = this.nlp.measurePerformance();
    const mlPerformance = this.machineLearningModel.measurePerformance();

    // Draws the comprehensive performance of the solution
    const overallPerformance = (0.5 * nlpPerformance) + (0.5 * mlPerformance);
  
    return overallPerformance;
  }
}

module.exports = DrVirtuosoSolution;
```

In this pseudocode, you've successfully tackled a complex problem by incorporating multiple AI approaches, such as Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. However, this is merely a pseudocode and may not run as expected. The concept here is showing how you can decompose complex problems into understandable parts, and then treat each part with a suitable solution. Additionally, it illustrates mindfully crafted and well-structured code that properly modularizes functionality. This way, each model can be managed, debugged, and potentially reused separately, which is a vital practice for large and complex projects.
