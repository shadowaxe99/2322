I recommend creating a model that implements Machine Learning, specifically Supervised Learning, using React and Redux for state management of the components. This solution would read and process large datasets, predicting outcomes based on the input data.

Here is an example of a simplified version of a component that could be used to train a model:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { processData } from '../redux/actions';
import '../styles/DrVirtuoso.css';

const DrVirtuosoComponent = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const dataset = useSelector(state => state.dataset);
  const [outcome, setOutcome] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    dispatch(processData());
  }, [dispatch]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (dataset) {
      setOutcome(trainModel(dataset));
    }
  }, [dataset]);

  const trainModel = (dataset) => {
    // Include Machine Learning algorithms here 
    // You may use libraries like TensorFlow.js
  };

  return (
    <div id="DrVirtuosoComponent">
      <h2>Dr. A.I. Virtuoso Prediction Modeller</h2>
      <div className="outcome">
        {outcome ? <p>{`Predicted Outcome: ${outcome}`}</p> : <p>Loading...</p>}
      </div>
  </div>
  );
};

export default DrVirtuosoComponent;
```
This example is purely hypothetical and is not comprehensive, as Machine Learning models are complex and beyond a simple representation like the above. However, it represents the spirit of complex problem-solving that a top-level developer and AI expert like Dr. A.I. Virtuoso would use.
