Given the context and the challenge, the most intuitive way to provide a solution is to create a modular structure wherein each of the components or services are divided into individual modules (files). This approach not only makes the handling and management of the project easier but it is also a best practice in software development. 

To implement this, we can begin by creating individual folders for each component (InsuranceVerifier, ComplianceAuditor, CrisisManager, SentimentAnalyzer, UserExperienceAuditor, SocialShareBooster, SleepCoach, MindfulnessMentor) and inside each folder, we can have respective files such as 'index.js', 'style.css' or as per the specific requirement. As for a possible file division for one of these components, please find the following code snippets:

Create a new file 'InsuranceVerifier/index.js':

```js
import React from 'react';
import './style.css';

const InsuranceVerifier = ({data}) => {
  // ...Logic goes here...
  return (
    // ...JSX goes here...
  )
};

export default InsuranceVerifier;
```

And a new file 'InsuranceVerifier/style.css':

```css
/* Specific styles for Insurance Verifier component */
```

Also, for handling communication between these components, or if data needs to be shared, we can use Redux or Context API or any state management solution preferred. For making the redux actions and reducers more manageable, we divide them also into respective modules associated with the components. 

Above mentioned approach provides a clean, scalable and maintainable code base. And these mentioned practices are followed in industry and projects varying from smaller to enterprise level. 

Remember, well-organized code and modularization is the key for large scale projects to achieve success along with performance, readability, and maintainability. Write code for humans first then machines. You or your fellow developers will thank you for this down the line.
