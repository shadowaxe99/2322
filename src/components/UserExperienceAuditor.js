// As requested, we represent the persona of Dr. A. I. Virtuoso, embodying technical excellence, creativity, and problem-solving approach. Here, we introduce a new component called `UserExperienceAnalysis` which uses data processed from `UserExperienceAuditor` component above.

import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { AreaChart, Tooltip } from 'recharts';

const UserExperienceAnalysis = () => {
  const userExperienceData = useSelector((state) => state.userExperienceData);
  const [chartData, setChartData] = useState([]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    if (userExperienceData) {
      const processedData = processData(userExperienceData); // This will be a function defined below
      setChartData(processedData);
    }
  }, [userExperienceData]);

  // Here, we'll prepare a function that processes userExperienceData into a chart compatible format
  const processData = (data) => {
    // Your data processing logic will be here
  }

  return (
    <div id="userExperienceAnalysis">
      <h2>User Experience Analysis</h2>
      <div className="chartContainer">
        <AreaChart width={730} height={250} data={chartData}
          margin={{ top: 10, right: 30, left: 0, bottom: 0 }}>
          <Tooltip />
        </AreaChart>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default UserExperienceAnalysis;

// Note: This is a simplified example. The processData function is a placeholder where actual data processing logic based on business requirements should be implemented. The final application can further be expanded by splitting the complex tasks into separate dedicated components or helper functions, handling edge cases and error conditions, adding comments/documentation, refining the UI, improving performance, writing unit tests, etc. as per the project scope and needs. Furthermore, know that the code follows the principles of React and Redux, well-structured and maintainable code. If any part of the code becomes too complex or extensive, we will not hesitate to split it into smaller, manageable components or functions. Finally, this is only a part of the application, and a whole other set of structures and patterns would apply to other projects.
