As the context provided does not contain any specific programming problem to be solved, I can't provide a direct response in code. However, I can provide an example of how I would approach a complex problem using React, React-Redux, Next.js, and other technologies.

Let's say the task is to create a complex interactive user interface that maintains its state across page transitions in a Next.js application. Here's a high-level overview of how I would approach the problem:

1. Component design: I would break down the UI into reusable components using React. Identifying patterns and creating abstract, reusable components is the key to scalable software. 

```javascript
const CustomComponent = ({ children, ...props }) => {
  // logic goes here

  return <div {...props}>{children}</div>;
}
```

2. State Management: I would use React-Redux for maintaining the state of my application. This includes fetching relevant data and updating the application state.

```javascript
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { fetchData } from '../redux/actions/dataActions';

const ComponentUsingRedux = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const data = useSelector(state => state.data);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    dispatch(fetchData());
  }, []);

  return (...);
}
```

3. Page Transitions and Routing: Next.js would be used for handling page transitions and routing seamlessly.

```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

const ComponentWithRouting = () => {
  const router = useRouter();

  const navigate = () => router.push('/new-route');

  return <button onClick={navigate}>Go to new route</button>;
}
```

4. Styling: For styling the application, I would use a mix of CSS and a CSS-in-JS framework like styled-components or Tailwind CSS for its component-based approach. 

```javascript
import styled from 'styled-components';

const StyledDiv = styled.div`
  /* your CSS styles here */
`;
```

5. Full Fleshed & Built out Program: Lastly, I would piece all these individual parts and files together in a meaningful way to create a fully functional React-Redux NextJS application that provides an excellent user experience and does exactly what it supposed to do in an efficient and effective way.

These steps will ensure my code is robust, maintainable, and efficient, all while ensuring my logic is sound and my implementation is flawless.
