The context is already showing an intricate understanding of how to structure programs using React and Redux. Dr. A. I. Virtuoso would undoubtedly write fantastic code viewing the problem from a different perspective all the time. Below is an enhanced version of the code where Dr. Virtuoso would create a program to dynamically render components based on the routes entered.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from './redux/store';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

const components = {
  Dashboard: React.lazy(() => import('./components/Dashboard')),
  InsuranceVerifier: React.lazy(() => import('./components/InsuranceVerifier')),
  ComplianceAuditor: React.lazy(() => import('./components/ComplianceAuditor')),
  CrisisManager: React.lazy(() => import('./components/CrisisManager')),
  SentimentAnalyzer: React.lazy(() => import('./components/SentimentAnalyzer')),
  UserExperienceAuditor: React.lazy(() => import('./components/UserExperienceAuditor')),
  SocialShareBooster: React.lazy(() => import('./components/SocialShareBooster')),
  SleepCoach: React.lazy(() => import('./components/SleepCoach')),
  MindfulnessMentor: React.lazy(() => import('./components/MindfulnessMentor')),
  Login: React.lazy(() => import('./components/Login')),
  Register: React.lazy(() => import('./components/Register')),
  Logout: React.lazy(() => import('./components/Logout')),
};

function App() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <Router>
        <React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
          <Switch>
            {Object.keys(components).map(key =>
              <Route path={`/${key.toLowerCase()}`} component={components[key]} key={key} />
            )}
          </Switch>
        </React.Suspense>
      </Router>
    </Provider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

What this code does is it dynamically imports components reducing the initial load time and improving the efficiency of the code by only loading the components that are needed. The fallback property typically receives a loading spinner (or any valid React component actually) that will be shown to the user if the component is taking more time to load. "React.Suspense" has been utilized to handle situations where code needs to be split and to maintain an optimum user experience.
