From the given context, we can't provide a concrete example as it's not clear what the specific requirements of the project are. However, being an AI and Computer Science expert, I would approach this task by following the below highlighted approach:

1. **Research and Define Goals**: Understand the project requirements, its intended audience, and what problems the application will solve.
2. **Design and Plan**: Draw up an architectural plan of the software, including how different components will interact. Considerations such as how state management (with Redux in this context) will be done should fall here.
3. **Development**: Start developing the code base following clean code practices, breaking the code into manageable modules and reusable components for effective debugging and less complexity.
4. **Testing**: Apply unit and integration tests to ensure code behaves as expected, using Jest and Enzyme, or the React Testing Library.
5. **Review** and **Refactor**: Regularly review the code, and refactor where necessary, to improve readability and performance.

If a challenge arises, I would certainly break the problem down into smaller parts, tackling each one separately, defining it in the best way possible and stitching them together harmoniously as a piece of a whole - like performing a symphony.

Here is a sample code snippet based on the provided context:

```javascript
// Action Types
export const actionTypes = {
  SET_VALUE: 'SET_VALUE',
};

// Action Creators
export function setValue(data) {
  return { type: actionTypes.SET_VALUE, data };
}

// Reducers
export function rootReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case actionTypes.SET_VALUE:
      return Object.assign({}, state, { value: action.data });
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

// Selectors
export const getValue = (state) => state.value;

// Component
import { setValue } from './actions';
import { getValue } from './selectors';

function MyComponent({ value, setValue, ...props }) {
  return (
    <input
      type="text"
      value={value}
      onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)}
    />
  );
}

// Mapping state to props
const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  value: getValue(state),
});

// Connecting component to Redux
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

export default connect(mapStateToProps, { setValue })(MyComponent);
```

For a real-world scenario where we could go into detailing, more clarity on the problem that needs to be solved is necessary. Nonetheless, the provided code is a basic representation of React & Redux functioning together, and would need adjustments based on the exact problem to solve.
