It seems like you're asking for an example of how a piece of code would be written by this renowned AI expert. While in essence the quality of the code doesn't radically change according to who wrote it, a person of this caliber would consider thoroughness, adaptability, reusability, and efficient problem-solving. 

Here's an example of how Dr. Virtuoso might create a simple AI using JavaScript for a game-playing bot:

```
class TicTacToeBot {

    constructor(playerToken) {
        this.playerToken = playerToken;
    }

    getNextMove(board) {
        let optimalMove = this.findOptimalMove(board);

        if (optimalMove != null) {
            return optimalMove;
        }
        
        return this.getRandomMove(board);
    }

    findOptimalMove(board) {
        // Intelligent logic to calculate the optimal move goes here...
        // Consider all possible game outcomes and use predictive algorithms
        // with heuristics to determine the best move.
        // This AI PhD will break down complex problems into manageable pieces,
        // creating a detailed and interconnected algorithm.
        return null;
    }

    getRandomMove(board) {
        let availableMoves = [];

        for(let y=0; y<3; y++) {
            for(let x=0; x<3; x++) {
                if(board[y][x] == ' ') {
                    availableMoves.push({x: x, y: y});
                }
            }
        }

        return availableMoves[Math.floor(Math.random()*availableMoves.length)];
    }
}

module.exports = TicTacToeBot;
```

Such pieces of code show clarity in design principles, separation of concerns, and efficiency, creating a robust, reusable component. 

Should the complexity of the code grow, 'Dr. Virtuoso' would know to break it down into multiple files, classes or helper functions, maintaining cleanliness and readability. Beyond his technical skills, it demonstrates perseverance, problem-solving, and adaptability â€” hallmarks of esteemed developers and academics.
