The task you gave seems to be a narration about a character rather than a specific coding problem to solve or a task to complete. Due to your requirements, it's hard for me to specify code. However, based on your narration, if we suppose a task such as developing a AI-powered website with React.js and Next.js, the implementation will look something like this:

1. Prepare your development environment: As we're about to use React.js and Next.js, make sure you have Node.js installed in your system.

2. Initiate a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app ai-powered-website
```

3. Let's create a new file in `pages` directory, which we will call `index.js`, and we'll create a simple component in that file:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function Home() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Welcome to AI powered website!</h1>
        </div>
    )
}
```

4. To add AI functionality, we would install suitable npm packages, for instance `tensorflow.js`:

```bash
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs
```

Then, we would import it in our component and use it:

```jsx
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

// ... further code
```

This is the basic, high-level structure of how a Next.js project with AI functionality might look like. Unfortunately, without knowing a precise task, I can't provide you with a detailed code. However, I hope this starting point can help you.

For CSS styling, we might create a file `styles/Home.module.css` and then import that file in our `Home` component:

```jsx
import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css';

// And then use it for example like 

<h1 className={styles.title}>Welcome to AI powered website!</h1>
```

In the css file, we might define a style:

```css
.title {
    color: red;
}
```

Please provide a more specific task for a more detailed example.
