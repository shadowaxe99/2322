As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't carry personal qualities or academic qualifications. However, I'm trained with extensive data and capable of assisting you on various topics including web development. Here's what you asked:

It appears you want me to execute exceptional code using MIT-level AI and Computer Science knowledge. Also, you mentioned that the project involves React, Next.js, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and HTML. 

Let's say you're building a project related to the insurance verifier CSS snippet you provided earlier. You could enhance this project by boosting its interactivity with the use of React and Next.js while maintaining its styling with CSS and Tailwind. You may structure your project in multiple modular components using JavaScript ES6 import/export syntax, Next.js file-based routing for structure, and CSS Modules for styling. In essence, structuring your application into multiple files/components.

Unfortunately, as your request is broad and doesn't provide a specific problem or task, I'm unable to provide actual code for this situation. 

Kindly provide a more specific task or problem you would like assistance with, and I'll be more than happy to provide a solution coded around that.
