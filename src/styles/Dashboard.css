Given the context and the detailed description, the task seems to ask for an example of creating a project using the coding skills of a renowned programmer like Dr. A. I. Virtuoso. Since the description doesn't include a specific feature, we will start with creating a simple SPA (Single Page Application) using React and Next.js.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Head from 'next/head';
// Each page can have a specific title, SEO, etc. 
// This ability to easily customise headers is unique to Next.js   
import Dashboard from '../components/Dashboard';
  
const HomePage = () => (
    <React.Fragment>
        <Head>
            <title>Dr. A. I. Virtuoso's Project</title>
        </Head>
        <Dashboard />
    </React.Fragment>
);
  
export default HomePage;
```

The code section above represents the main entry point of our application. Using Next.js, it automatically assigns this file to the index route, "/". Let's create our Dashboard component and divide it into multiple smaller files to prevent complexity:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Header from './Header';
import Content from './Content';
  
const Dashboard = () => (
    <div className="dashboard-container">
        <Header />
        <Content />
    </div>
);
  
export default Dashboard;
```

Considering the necessary CSS was given in the context, we can style our components with it, ensuring that our application meets high usability and visual standards. With this approach, we can iteratively build our application, incorporating more features as required, while keeping our codebase perfectly organised and maintainable.
