Sure, as the context is already provided with some good examples of fetching data through the endpoints, I'd suggest using a higher-order function here to create those fetch functions on the fly, so that it doesn't contain repetitive code. This is one of the ways we can use our creative problem-solving skills.

Replace all the fetch functions with the piece of code below:

```Javascript
const fetcher = (path) => async () => {
    try {
        const response = await axios.get(`${BASE_URL}/${path}`);
        return response.data;
    } catch (error) {
        throw error;
    }
};

const fetchPaths = [
    "dashboard",
    "insurance",
    "compliance",
    "crisis",
    "sentiment",
    "user-experience",
    "social-share",
    "sleep",
    "mindfulness"
];

const FETCH_FUNCTIONS = fetchPaths.reduce((accumulator, currentPath) => {
    const functionName = `fetch${currentPath.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + currentPath.slice(1)}Data`;
    accumulator[functionName] = fetcher(currentPath);
    return accumulator;
}, {});

export default FETCH_FUNCTIONS;
```

Each string in `fetchPaths` represents a part of the path the `axios` has to navigate to fetch the data. The `fetcher` function returns a function that fetches data from `${BASE_URL}/${path}`. We then simply iterate through `fetchPaths` and for each path the `fetcher` function is called and wrapped in a function, which then is added to an object with a dynamically generated function name, which can then be exported and used elsewhere in the program.

The dynamically named functions can be accessed as follows:

```Javascript
import FETCH_FUNCTIONS from './pathToFile';

const fetchDashboardData = FETCH_FUNCTIONS.fetchDashboardData;
const fetchSleepData = FETCH_FUNCTIONS.fetchSleepData;
// And so on for every other type of data.
```

With this method, adding a new fetch function for new data requires only adding the new path string to the `fetchPaths` array and everything else is done automatically.
