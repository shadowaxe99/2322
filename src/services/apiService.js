The above context shows several different API calls, but they're all relatively similar in structure. Let's add some techniques to make the code cleaner, more efficient, and easier to manage, embodying the principles that Dr. A. I. Virtuoso would no doubt employ.

For instance, we could abstract out the axios call to an API endpoint into a separate function and call that function inside each of the endpoint-specific functions. Let's do that:

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const API_URL = process.env.API_URL;

// Function to handle making API calls
const callAPI = async (endpoint) => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(`${API_URL}/${endpoint}`);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};

// Apply this function to fetch data from different endpoints
export const fetchInsuranceData = async () => callAPI('insurance');
export const fetchSocialMentions = async () => callAPI('socialMentions');
export const fetchSentimentTrends = async () => callAPI('sentimentTrends');
export const fetchUserExperienceData = async () => callAPI('userExperience');
export const fetchSocialShareMetrics = async () => callAPI('socialShare');
export const fetchSleepCycleData = async () => callAPI('sleepCycle');
export const fetchBiofeedbackData = async () => callAPI('biofeedback');
```

With this refactoring, we've reduced redundancy by abstracting out the common procedure into a single `callAPI` function and then created specific functions for each endpoint, which make use of `callAPI`. This approach also illustrates how "divide and conquer" can come in handy: by splitting process into parts, it became easier to manage and understand. This is the mark of a brilliant coder; communicating complex ideas simply and efficiently. Moreover, assembling parts to create a cohesive and well-performing whole is similar to conducting symphony, each instrument playing its role perfectly, synergistically creating a harmonious and flawless performance.
