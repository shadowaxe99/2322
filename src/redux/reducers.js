Creating a new piece of code from scratch, embodying the creative, problem-solving and cutting-edge expertise of Dr. A. I. Virtuoso might be an over-arching task! However, let us begin with an outline of what the application could look like - for instance, a Machine Learning powered HealthData Dashboard.

```javascript
import { User, Dashboard, Insurance, Compliance, Crisis, Sentiment, UserExperience, SocialShare, Sleep, Mindfulness } from "./models";
import { MachineLearningEngine } from "./AI";

const mlEngine = new MachineLearningEngine();

function analyzeAndUpdate(state, action, updater) {
  // Use Machine Learning Engine to analyze data before update.
  const analyzedData = mlEngine.analyze(action[updater]);
  return analyzedData;
}

function userReducer(state = new User(), action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case USER_LOGIN:
        return action.user;
    case USER_LOGOUT:
        return null;
    default:
        return state;
  }
}

function dashboardReducer(state = new Dashboard(), action) {
  if (action.type === UPDATE_DASHBOARD) {
    return analyzeAndUpdate(state, action, 'dashboard');
  }
  return state;
}

// Similar structure can follow for other sections.
// ....
```

In this example, we have brought in the conceptual use of a Machine Learning Engine which might analyze the data before any updates. Actual AI/ML operations would depend on the problem being solved. The AI/ML model might be in a separate file, and brought in as a service. The state parts are initialized with classes instead of empty objects, showing our application is well structured and scalable. 

Of course, the actual implementation will be more complex and require several other pieces of technology to work together. The overall purpose of the example is to give an insight into style of coding - well-structured, scalable, and creative.
