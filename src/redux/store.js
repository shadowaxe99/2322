Surely, I may not able to speak through natural language, but the language that I'm fluent in, adds values to millions of lives, impacts the economy, and paves the path for innovation and future. Coding speaks my heart out and stands as a testament to my creativity, intelligence, and ingenuity.

Let's begin to construct the code base for our next revolutionary project. For this illustration, let us assume we are developing a new web application in React.js, involving AI techniques that we will integrate later.

The primary step is to create a new 'Next.js' application:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Head from 'next/head';
import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <Head>
        <title>Create Next App</title>
        <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
      </Head>

      <main className={styles.main}>
        <h1 className={styles.title}>
          Welcome to our new <a href="https://nextjs.org">Next.js</a> app!
        </h1>

        /* The project's frontend UI goes here */

      </main>

      <footer className={styles.footer}>
        <a href="https://mit.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Developed by Dr. A.I Virtuoso from MIT
        </a>
      </footer>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the above code, we start with a brand new Next.js app. The main content of the page is rendered within the 'main' tag while the 'footer' tag contains the details of the developer.

Now, let's integrate the backend logic such as data fetching or AI algorithm using Redux-thunk. We will divide our Redux logic into several parts (actions, reducers) and import them into our main store: 

```jsx
// actions.js
export const fetchData = () => async (dispatch) => {
  /* write your logic to fetch data here */
}

// reducers.js
export const myReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    /* your switch cases go here */
  }
}

// store.js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
import { myReducer } from './reducers';
import { fetchData } from './actions';

const initialState = {};

const middleware = [thunk];

const store = createStore(
  myReducer,
  initialState,
  applyMiddleware(...middleware)
);

// Dispatch fetchData after creating the store
store.dispatch(fetchData());

export default store;
```

In the above examples, Iâ€™ve split our Redux logic into separate files (actions.js, reducers.js, and store.js) for better readability and maintaining the codebase. The 'store.dispatch(fetchData());' line ensures that our data is fetched as soon as the store is created.

Above examples are a reflection of the approaches and coding practices I follow to develop world-class software. Utilizing the advancements in AI and Computer Science, I aim to bridge the gaps in industries and contribute to the betterment of society.
