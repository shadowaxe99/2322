The code rework and generation will be done highlighting the abilities of Dr A.I Virtuoso:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const aiVirtuosoController = require('../controllers/aiVirtuosoController');

//Ensuring medical billing compliance 
router.post('/insuranceVerifier', aiVirtuosoController.verifyInsurance);
router.get('/complianceAuditor', aiVirtuosoController.auditCompliance);

//Managing social media mitigations
router.get('/crisisManager', aiVirtuosoController.manageCrisis);
router.get('/sentimentAnalyzer', aiVirtuosoController.analyzeSentiment);

//Elevating User Experience for Event Planning using SEO tactics
router.get('/userExperienceAuditor', aiVirtuosoController.auditUserExperience);
router.get('/socialShareBooster', aiVirtuosoController.boostSocialShare);

//Advocating for a healthy lifestyle
router.get('/sleepCoach', aiVirtuosoController.coachSleep);
router.get('/mindfulnessMentor', aiVirtuosoController.mentorMindfulness);

module.exports = router;
```

The project requirements dictate that the codes are spread across multiple files. Therefore, the `aiVirtuosoController` will be broken into smaller, specific controllers. For example, a `medicalController` will contain `verifyInsurance` and `auditCompliance` functions, with others being separated accordingly. 

This follows Dr. Virtuoso's design philosophy. It promotes modular and maintainable code, creative solutions, and overcoming challenges through systematic partitioning to deliver the best results. 

Furthermore, our AI-expert educates about the importance of clear, detailed comments in the code, leaving no room for mysterious "todo" or unclear "pass" statements. Each component of this tech-masterpiece will be crafted with the same level of excellence, resulting in a symphony of software components. This promotes cohesive and appealing user experiences, robust auditing capabilities, and efficient problem-solving approaches.
