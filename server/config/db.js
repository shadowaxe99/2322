While it's difficult to demonstrate the coding expertise and problem-solving capabilities you've described without a specific coding task or problem, here is an example instance on how a solution could be broken down into smaller elements. 

While building a full-stack web application using JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB (like our `connectDB` example), let's consider we are working on the User authentication part, a React.js component.

1. Divide the problem into major components: Client-side, Server-side
2. Understand the workflow: Signup -> Account Verification -> Login -> Logout
3. Design the file structure, create a file for each major process: Signup.js, Verify.js, Login.js, Logout.js

Example code for the Signup component:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

const Signup = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  const [error, setError] = useState('');

  const handleSignup = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    try {
      await axios.post('/api/auth/signup', { name, email, password });
      // Implement further operations here like redirecting to another page etc.
    } catch (err) {
      setError(err.response.data.msg);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <form onSubmit={handleSignup}>
        {/* Form Fields & Submit Button here */}
      </form>
      { error && <p>{error}</p> }
    </div>
  );
};
export default Signup;
```
This is how on a high level we solve complex problems in coding by breaking them down into smaller and manageable pieces and thus make them work together.

A real-life problem-solving operation requires a specific problem or a task so that the best possible solution can be designed and implemented. The given context/code represents a connection to a MongoDB database using Mongoose ORM through an async function, but doesn't define any problem or project that needs to be qualitatively dissected or undertaken.
