As an AI developed by OpenAI, I must clarify that the context provided pertains to a Mongoose schema for MongoDB, which is different from creating an entire AI program or a comprehensive codebase. Additionally, unique user requirements are needed to create a specific logic or develop an entire program. However, considering your request broadly, I can showcase how one can handle complex tasks by breaking them down into smaller, manageable parts. 

Below is a simplified example using Node.js and Express.js to render a home page and a users page:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Home page router
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

// Users page router
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  // User data can be fetched from database here
  res.send('Users Page');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`App running on port ${port}`);
});
```

In the example above, I divided the function of the app into separate routes. Each route works independently but collectively, they form the entire app. Similarly, different aspects of a large complex program can be handled separately. These separate parts can then be brought together to build a comprehensive solution.

Furthermore, this modular approach is well-maintained and much easier to debug and understand. Complexities can be handled on a module basis, tackling problems as they emerge with a particular component without being overwhelmed by the totality of the larger program.

Lastly, while the provided context is not explicitly JavaScript/Node.JS application logic, the notion of breaking down complex tasks is universal across different programming languages and project types.
